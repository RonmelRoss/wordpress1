=== Full-featured cookie and consent management for WordPress ===

Real Cookie Banner is a WordPress plugin that enables you to obtain consent to load services and set cookies in accordance with the GDPR (DSGVO) and ePrivacy Directive (EU Cookie Law). In addition, we ensure for you that styles, scripts, iframes, etc. are only loaded when users give their consent with so-called Content Blockers. To be on the safe side, you should document all consents of your website to prove them in case of doubt. An automatic documentation of consents is also included in this plugin.

**(Why) do I need an opt-in cookie banner?**

Nearly all websites that target users from the EU require a cookie banner that obtains explicit consent (opt-in procedure) and documents the consent. It is practically impossible to operate a website without cookies and external services requiring consent, as otherwise you would have to go without many features and services such as Google Analytics, Google Fonts, YouTube videos, personal recommendations, etc.

Legally, the obligation is based on the ePrivacy Directive ([Directive 2009/136/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32009L0136)) Art. 66, which describes that the setting of cookies that are not strictly technically necessary requires the explicit consent of the user. The ePrivacy Directive has not yet been transposed into national law by a lot of EU countries (including German), but according to current legal opinion, it must be applied nevertheless.

Some German users will have [§ 15 para. 3 TMG](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__15.html) as the German solution to the cookie issue in mind. The paragraph assumes that consent is granted automatically if the user does not object (opt-out procedure). However, the ECJ clarified on October 1, 2019 in [case C-673/17](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=D5DC4CA415C605B28E70747FD3C5158C?text=&docid=218462&pageIndex=0&doclang=DE&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=1458627) that the German special way of an opt-out procedure is not in accordance with the ePrivacy Directive and since then it must be assumed that only the opt-in procedure is permissible. This was also confirmed by the Federal Court of Justice for Germany on May 28, 2020 ([Case I ZR 7/16](https://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?Text=I%20ZR%207/16) - Cookie Consent II).

Contrary to the assumption of many, the GDPR plays only a minor role in this respect. Although it defines how personal data must be processed, it explicitly leaves the question of how to deal with cookies to the ePrivacy Directive. However, it does regulate the penalties if data protection violations are committed through the unauthorized transfer of personal data.

**What if I don't have an opt-in cookie banner?**

The [first warnings are already being sent out](https://www.anwalt.de/rechtstipps/dsgvo-abmahnung-wegen-rechtswidrigem-cookie-banner-und-tracking_160094.html) today because of the accusation of a data protection violation due to the illegal use of cookies. In this case, a cease-and-desist declaration and compensation will be demanded. At this point, it is advisable to seek legal advice in order to avoid falling into further legal traps.

A risk already exists today due to the ECJ decision of October 1, 2019 in [case C-673/17](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=D5DC4CA415C605B28E70747FD3C5158C?text=&docid=218462&pageIndex=0&doclang=DE&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=1458627). We assume that the number of warnings will increase as soon as the ePrivacy Directive is replaced by the ePrivacy Regulation (ePVO). At the latest then, the risk of a warning should no longer be taken.

**Why another cookie banner/content plugin?**

There are already widely used cookie banner solutions like Borlabs Cookie, Complianz, GDPR Cookie Consent, GDPR Cookie Compliance or Cookie Notice for GDPR & CCPA. In our point of view, many of these solutions only partially implement the legal requirements or advised behavior, which bears a risk for website operators. Without a serious look at the law, you won't know about it until you get a warning in your mailbox. In addition, most solutions are not so flexible and customizable that we would recommend using them on a professional website.

We have implemented a cookie banner plugin that in our opinion meets the legal requirements, is very flexible and customizable, can be set up legally correct in only about an hour and solves many other problems. Through a market research and survey with WordPress users before we started the development of the cookie content tool, we have identified many issues. We have tested the implemented solution intensively in user tests in practice, so that we can offer you a comprehensive and intuitive solution.

Try Real Cookie Banner and replace e.g. your legally questionable cookie notice with our powerful cookie consent management solution!
